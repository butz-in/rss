The lessons are many, but I want to focus on one important one we’ve learned: the software that’s managing our critical networks isn’t secure, and that’s because the market doesn’t reward that security.</p>\n<p>SolarWinds is a perfect example. The company was the initial infection vector for much of the operation. Its trusted position inside so many critical networks made it a perfect target for a supply-chain attack, and its shoddy security practices made it an easy target...</p>",

These backdoors force the system to err only on specific persons which are preselected by the attacker. For example, we show how such a backdoored system can take any two images of a particular person and decide that they represent different persons (an anonymity attack), or take any two images of a particular pair of persons and decide that they represent the same person (a confusion attack), with almost no effect on the correctness of its decisions for other persons. Uniquely, we show that multiple backdoors can be independently installed by multiple attackers who may not be aware of each other&#8217;s existence with almost no interference...</p></blockquote>",

Proprietors of these so-called “booter” or “stresser” services — designed to knock websites and users offline — have long operated in a legally murky area of cybercrime law. But until recently, their biggest concern wasn’t avoiding capture or shutdown by the feds: It was minimizing harassment from unhappy customers or victims, and insulating themselves against incessant attacks from competing DDoS-for-hire services.\r\n\r\nAnd then there are booter store operators like John Dobbs, a 32-year-old computer science graduate student living in Honolulu, Hawaii. For at least a decade until late last year, Dobbs openly operated IPStresser[.]com, a popular and powerful attack-for-hire service that he registered with the state of Hawaii using his real name and address. Likewise, the domain was registered in Dobbs’s name and hometown in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe only work experience Dobbs listed on his resume was as a freelance developer from 2013 to the present day. Dobbs’s resume doesn’t name his booter service, but in it he brags about maintaining websites with half a million page views daily, and “designing server deployments for performance, high-availability and security.”\r\n\r\nIn December 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice seized Dobbs’s IPStresser website and charged him with one count of aiding and abetting computer intrusions. Prosecutors say his service attracted more than two million registered users, and was responsible for launching a staggering 30 million distinct DDoS attacks.",

The research firm found that the stressors of the cybersecurity world make the job of a cybersecurity professional unsustainable. This includes the knowledge that there are only two possible outcomes: get hacked or don’t. “The psychological impact of this is profound, directly affecting decision quality and performance of cybersecurity leaders and their teams,” found Gartner.\nAlthough burnout is nothing new, it did become more visible and common during and after COVID-19. For CISOs it is worse as more than 50% are challenged with work demands that lead to a poor work-life balance at least once a month.

The increasingly sophisticated nature of attacks is the biggest challenge for 59% of respondents, with 76% predicting that an email-borne attack will have serious consequences for their organization in the coming year. Of these, 7% believe that such an attack is “inevitable,” while another three out of 10 consider it “extremely likely.”\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

The company only discovered the security breach following customer reports in early December 2022 that their sites were being used to redirect to random domains.\n“Based on our investigation, we believe these incidents are part of a multi-year campaign by a sophisticated threat actor group that, among other things, installed malware on our systems and obtained pieces of code related to some services within GoDaddy,” the filing added.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

          "description": "The last year saw a rise in the sophistication and number of attacks targeting industrial infrastructure, including the discovery of a modular malware toolkit that's capable of targeting tens of thousands of industrial control systems (ICS) across different industry verticals. At the same time, incident response engagements by industrial cybersecurity firm Dragos showed that 80% of impacted environments lacked visibility into ICS traffic and half had network segmentation issues and uncontrolled external connections into their OT networks.\n\"A number of the threats that Dragos tracks may evolve their disruptive and destructive capabilities in the future because adversaries often do extensive research and development (R&D) and build their programs and campaigns over time,\" the Dragos researchers said in a newly released annual report. \"This R&D informs their future campaigns and ultimately increases their disruptive capabilities.\"\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

The firm has detailed four recent HTML smuggling campaigns attempting to lure users into saving and opening malicious payloads, impersonating well-known brands such as Adobe Acrobat, Google Drive, and the US Postal Service to increase the chances of users falling victim.\nHTML smuggling uses HTML5 attributes that can work offline by storing a binary in an immutable blob of data (or embedded payload) within JavaScript code, which is decoded into a file object when opened via a web browser. It is not a new attack method, but it has grown in popularity since Microsoft started blocking macros in documents from the internet by default, Trustwave SpiderLabs wrote. The four malware strains that have recently been detected using HTML smuggling in their infection chain are Cobalt Strike, Qakbot, IcedID, and Xworm RAT, the firm added.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

While some may write this off as geopolitical shenanigans by China and nothing to fret about, I submit that it is emblematic of a nation-state using all resources available to acquire pieces of information and fill in the blanks on the mosaic they are building about a potential adversarial nation.\nThe physical threat posed by this balloon and the collection platform that dangled below it was negligible unless the balloon fell from the sky and landed in a populated area.

Security engineering teams are typically made up of software and infrastructure engineers, architects, and product managers.\nThe collective security/security engineering team mindset is also that of a builder, quite different from that of a penetration tester or third-party risk management assessor.

          "description": "If there’s an intrusion or a ransomware attack on your company, will your security team come out swinging, ready for a real fight? CISOs may feel their staff is always primed with the technical expertise and training they need, but there’s still a chance they might freeze up when the pressure is on, says Bec McKeown, director of human science at cybersecurity training platform Immersive Labs.\n“You may have a crisis playbook and crisis policies and you may assume those are the first things you’ll reach for during an incident. But that’s not always the case, because the way your brain works isn’t just fight or flight. It’s fight, flight, or freeze,” she says. “I’ve heard people say, ‘We knew how to respond to a crisis, but we didn’t know what to do when it actually happened.’”\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

This week, a proof-of-concept exploit chain has been released by security researchers, along with detailed explanations for each vulnerability, meaning in-the-wild attacks could soon follow.\n“Gaining access to the Log Insight host provides some interesting possibilities to an attacker, depending on the type of applications that are integrated with it,” researchers with penetration testing firm Horizon3.ai said in their analysis of the flaws. “Often logs ingested may contain sensitive data from other services and may allow an attack to gather session tokens, API keys, and PII.

In fact, almost half (48%) predicted that a successful cyberattack will be credited to the technology within the next 12 months.

          "description": "From the moment Microsoft released Windows 10 in 2015, the new OS came under fire for the amount of private information it gathered from users by default. Over the years, the vendor gradually introduced changes to Windows 10 that alleviated some of those privacy concerns, but some remain — and most of those apply to Windows 11 as well.\nWhether you think Windows 11 crosses the privacy line or just want to safeguard as much of your personal life as possible, we're here to help.

The problem: location data on every person carrying a mobile device in that area is scooped up in a wide net and their data is then handed over en masse to law enforcement.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

          "description": "Posted by Roger Piqueras Jover, Ivan Lozano, Sudhi Herle, and Stephan Somogyi, Android Team \nA modern Android powered smartphone is a complex hardware device: Android OS runs on a multi-core CPU - also called an Application Processor (AP). And the AP is one of many such processors of a System On Chip (SoC). Other processors on the SoC perform various specialized tasks — such as security functions, image & video processing, and most importantly cellular communications. The processor performing cellular communications is often referred to as the baseband. For the purposes of this blog, we refer to the software that runs on all these other processors as “Firmware”.  \nSecuring the Android Platform requires going beyond the confines of the Application Processor (AP). Android’s defense-in-depth …",

This year has been no exception, so we’re bringing you a list of the biggest security breaches that have happened so far this year. First, we’ll take a look at the breaches across the world that had a big impact on the companies and customers they targeted e.g., the first ever national emergency caused by ransomware. Then, we’ll put a spotlight on some of the breaches that happened near home for us at CyberPilot: breaches in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. We’ll wrap up with some trends in this year’s breaches and suggestions for how your organisation can prevent a breach.",

The novelty of the GDPR leaves regulators with little precedent to refer to and many supervisory authorities are still working out the best way to enforce the GDPR. In this post, we break down the rules you need to know about how GDPR violations are fined. We also spotlight some of the biggest GDPR fines from 2022 back to 2020 with insights into how you can avoid receiving a fine and which GDPR violations are being prioritized for enforcement.  \nTo learn more about how you can avoid GDPR violations, and train your team in the importance of secure data handling, we offer a course on taking responsibility for personal data, which is free of charge for 14 days.",

Because APIs – or application programming interfaces – are important. They’re the synapses of our digital world: without them, our current ways of living wouldn’t work.\nFor example, when you visit a website that requires you to log in, and you choose to connect with a Google or Facebook account, you’re utilising an API. That click of a button that links your existing account on one platform with a new account on another is enabled by an API. They spring into action whenever one type of work interacts with another, working to bridge that gap. APIs are the overlooked and under-praised army that keeps the internet as we know it going.\n Continue reading...",
