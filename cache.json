This was my response.</p>\n<p>The penetration of government and corporate networks worldwide is the result of inadequate cyberdefenses across the board. The lessons are many, but I want to focus on one important one we’ve learned: the software that’s managing our critical networks isn’t secure, and that’s because the market doesn’t reward that security.</p>\n<p>SolarWinds is a perfect example. The company was the initial infection vector for much of the operation. Its trusted position inside so many critical networks made it a perfect target for a supply-chain attack, and its shoddy security practices made it an easy target...</p>",

These backdoors force the system to err only on specific persons which are preselected by the attacker. For example, we show how such a backdoored system can take any two images of a particular person and decide that they represent different persons (an anonymity attack), or take any two images of a particular pair of persons and decide that they represent the same person (a confusion attack), with almost no effect on the correctness of its decisions for other persons. Uniquely, we show that multiple backdoors can be independently installed by multiple attackers who may not be aware of each other&#8217;s existence with almost no interference...</p></blockquote>",

Proprietors of these so-called “booter” or “stresser” services — designed to knock websites and users offline — have long operated in a legally murky area of cybercrime law. But until recently, their biggest concern wasn’t avoiding capture or shutdown by the feds: It was minimizing harassment from unhappy customers or victims, and insulating themselves against incessant attacks from competing DDoS-for-hire services.\r\n\r\nAnd then there are booter store operators like John Dobbs, a 32-year-old computer science graduate student living in Honolulu, Hawaii. For at least a decade until late last year, Dobbs openly operated IPStresser[.]com, a popular and powerful attack-for-hire service that he registered with the state of Hawaii using his real name and address. Likewise, the domain was registered in Dobbs’s name and hometown in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe only work experience Dobbs listed on his resume was as a freelance developer from 2013 to the present day. Dobbs’s resume doesn’t name his booter service, but in it he brags about maintaining websites with half a million page views daily, and “designing server deployments for performance, high-availability and security.”\r\n\r\nIn December 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice seized Dobbs’s IPStresser website and charged him with one count of aiding and abetting computer intrusions.

          "description": "Trustwave SpiderLabs researchers have cited an increased prevalence of HTML smuggling activity whereby cybercriminal groups abuse the versatility of HTML in combination with social engineering to distribute malware. The firm has detailed four recent HTML smuggling campaigns attempting to lure users into saving and opening malicious payloads, impersonating well-known brands such as Adobe Acrobat, Google Drive, and the US Postal Service to increase the chances of users falling victim.\nHTML smuggling uses HTML5 attributes that can work offline by storing a binary in an immutable blob of data (or embedded payload) within JavaScript code, which is decoded into a file object when opened via a web browser. It is not a new attack method, but it has grown in popularity since Microsoft started blocking macros in documents from the internet by default, Trustwave SpiderLabs wrote. The four malware strains that have recently been detected using HTML smuggling in their infection chain are Cobalt Strike, Qakbot, IcedID, and Xworm RAT, the firm added.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

While some may write this off as geopolitical shenanigans by China and nothing to fret about, I submit that it is emblematic of a nation-state using all resources available to acquire pieces of information and fill in the blanks on the mosaic they are building about a potential adversarial nation.\nThe physical threat posed by this balloon and the collection platform that dangled below it was negligible unless the balloon fell from the sky and landed in a populated area. It did not. When it met its demise, it was shot down by a US F-22 Raptor and fell into US territorial waters off the coast of South Carolina.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

          "description": "Security teams are comprised primarily of operations, compliance, and policy-related roles. Security engineering teams, on the other hand, are builders. They build services, automate processes, and streamline deployments to support the core security team and its stakeholders. Security engineering teams are typically made up of software and infrastructure engineers, architects, and product managers.\nThe collective security/security engineering team mindset is also that of a builder, quite different from that of a penetration tester or third-party risk management assessor. This presents a challenge to security leaders.

The attack chain also involves reconnaissance components including a Trojan that takes screenshots of the desktops of infected computers.\nTracked as TA866 by researchers from security firm Proofpoint, the group's tooling seems to have similarities to other campaigns reported in the past under different names going as far back as 2019.

As a consequence, the number of available tools to manage them has also risen.\nAn ESG survey of 380 security professionals in North America, commissioned by cybersecurity company Syxsense, showed that companies using larger numbers of different tools to manage their endpoints had larger proportions of unmanaged endpoints, compared to those with fewer.

          "description": "A critical vulnerability was fixed this week in Jira Service Management Server, a popular IT services management platform for enterprises, that could allow attackers to impersonate users and gain access to access tokens. If the system is configured to allow public sign-up, external customers can be affected as well.\nThe bug was introduced in Jira Service Management Server and Data Center 5.3.0, so versions 5.3.0 to 5.3.1 and 5.4.0 to 5.5.0 are affected. Atlassian has released fixed versions of the software but has also provided a workaround that involves updating a single JAR file in impacted deployments. Atlassian Cloud instances are not vulnerable.\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

This week, a proof-of-concept exploit chain has been released by security researchers, along with detailed explanations for each vulnerability, meaning in-the-wild attacks could soon follow.\n“Gaining access to the Log Insight host provides some interesting possibilities to an attacker, depending on the type of applications that are integrated with it,” researchers with penetration testing firm Horizon3.ai said in their analysis of the flaws. “Often logs ingested may contain sensitive data from other services and may allow an attack to gather session tokens, API keys, and PII. Those keys and sessions may allow the attacker to pivot to other systems and further compromise the environment.”\nTo read this article in full, please click here",

That’s according to a new study from BlackBerry, which surveyed 500 UK IT decision makers revealing that, while 60% of respondents see ChatGPT as generally being used for “good” purposes, 72% are concerned by its potential to be used for malicious purposes when it comes to cybersecurity. In fact, almost half (48%) predicted that a successful cyberattack will be credited to the technology within the next 12 months.

At least one North Korean group that was focused on South Korea and Russia has started using English in its operations.

That aid ranges from giving advice to identifying attacks, offering fixes for them, and providing Ukraine with free tech and security services.\nMicrosoft isn’t just trying to help defend a country under siege from an aggressive, more-powerful neighbor. Russian cyberattacks against Ukraine can also get loose in the wild and do damage to enterprises and organizations that rely on Microsoft technology.

Security awareness training teaches your colleagues how to practice good security habits and reduces the risk of a security breach. But at the end of the day, the kind of training you can give your colleagues often comes down to what your budget allows. In this blog post, we use data to explain why security training is well worth the upfront cost. For example, did you know that organisations have about a 30% chance of experiencing a security breach in the next two years? Or that using security training reduces the security cost of an employee by 52%? \n \r\nWe’ll go over training costs, the consequences of security breaches, and the average ROI of training.

And the ramifications are huge\n\nDon’t get TechScape delivered to your inbox? Sign up here\n\nAPIs may not seem like the sexiest thing to write about in a tech newsletter, but bear with me. Because APIs – or application programming interfaces – are important. They’re the synapses of our digital world: without them, our current ways of living wouldn’t work.\nFor example, when you visit a website that requires you to log in, and you choose to connect with a Google or Facebook account, you’re utilising an API. That click of a button that links your existing account on one platform with a new account on another is enabled by an API. They spring into action whenever one type of work interacts with another, working to bridge that gap. APIs are the overlooked and under-praised army that keeps the internet as we know it going.\n Continue reading...",

Her tattoos seem to be making the point, too. On her left forearm is a Latin phrase – facta non verba, actions not words – with a pair of devil’s horns; on her right, a feather, from the wings of an angel. Which is she, I wonder. Her boots – DM-like, many eyelets – suggest no angel; but the T-shirt is emblazoned with “Trust Me”.\nRadcliffe has an unusual job: she’s a social engineer. “Also known as a professional burglar, physical penetration tester … though it’s difficult to say that one to old ladies on trains,” she says.
