In addition, 48% of all code bases analyzed by Synopsys researchers contained high-risk vulnerabilities, which are those that have been actively exploited, already have documented proof-of-concept exploits, or are classified as remote code execution vulnerabilities. 
The vulnerability data — along with information on open source license compliance — was included in Synopsys' 2023 Open Source Security and Risk Analysis (OSSRA) report, put together by the company's Cybersecurity Research Center (CyRC).

Newsroom leverages deep and AI-assisted knowledge of a customer’s external attack surface to gauge its exposure to detected vulnerabilities and provides a summary of exploits, affected software and assets within the organization, Darktrace stated. It also provides vulnerability mitigation guidance specific to businesses, while early adoption has revealed insight on remote code injection flaws in Citrix Gateway/Citrix ADC, CentOS Web Panel 7 Servers, and Zoho ManageEngine products, according to the vendor. Darktrace Newsroom is now available as part of the Darktrace PREVENT product range.

The EU’s executive body has banned its thousands of staff from using TikTok over cybersecurity concerns, a decision the Chinese-owned social video app has criticised as “misguided” and based on “fundamental misconceptions”.
The European Commission sent an email to employees ordering them to delete the app from all work phones and devices, and any personally owned ones that use the commission’s apps and email. Employees have until 15 March to comply.

The research firm found that the stressors of the cybersecurity world make the job of a cybersecurity professional unsustainable. This includes the knowledge that there are only two possible outcomes: get hacked or don’t. “The psychological impact of this is profound, directly affecting decision quality and performance of cybersecurity leaders and their teams,” found Gartner.
Although burnout is nothing new, it did become more visible and common during and after COVID-19. For CISOs it is worse as more than 50% are challenged with work demands that lead to a poor work-life balance at least once a month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The threat landscape is highly diverse and attacks range in sophistication from the most basic scams to nation-state-level cyberespionage. However, companies need to prioritize their defenses against the most common threats that are likely to impact them and their employees.
In its newly released annual State of Malware report, cybersecurity firm Malwarebytes selected five threats that they consider to be archetypes for some of the most common malware families observed in 2022:

LockBit ransomware
The Emotet botnet
The SocGholish drive-by download
Android droppers
macOS Genio adware
"Protecting your business for the rest of 2023 requires one critical understanding: The most dangerous cyberthreats you will face are not the strangest attacks you will see on any given week, or the most sophisticated, or the most eye-catching. They are not even the most prevalent," the company said in its report. "Instead, the most dangerous threats come from a set of known, mature tools and tactics that an entire ecosystem of cybercriminals rely upon to take in billions of dollars a year."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cloud-based permissions management startup Entitle debuted Wednesday with the launch of its namesake SaaS-based application, designed to automate access requests and solve the problem of what it calls the "entitlement sprawl" faced by corporations.
Enterprise security teams are confronted with an overwhelming amount of permission requests, the Israel-based company said.
“We saw that permission management is becoming a big issue and interviewed heads of security about the challenges with governance and relevance of access,” said Ron Nissam, co-founder and CEO of Entitle. “We quickly realized that many of the challenges that security teams are facing in governance of access actually originated upstream in the IT and devops departments and how employees got permissions to begin with.”

The technological complexity and growing attack surface, along with a growing array of threat actors and increased interconnectivity, make securing digital systems and assets a perennial pipedream.
Chief among the challenges for decision-makers and experts is simply identifying and comprehending society's cybersecurity risks. One organization, the Washington, DC-based think tank Bipartisan Policy Center, has convened a working group of experts from industry, government, and civil society to "identify the nation's top cybersecurity risks to raise awareness so policymakers and businesses can take pragmatic action and invest in countermeasures."

It consists of sites that are not indexed by popular search engines such as Google, and the dark web includes marketplaces for data usually obtained as a result of a cyberattack such as compromised user accounts, identity information, or other confidential corporate information.
Gaining operational intelligence on what data these sites are offering is critical to defending cybercriminals using compromised accounts to enable attacks, commit fraud, or conduct campaigns using spear phishing or brand spoofing. The dark web is also  a source of intelligence on the operations, tactics, and intent of criminal groups. Tools that monitor the dark web for compromised data are available for these purposes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Being a CISO is a hard job. You must constantly balance business, technology, and regulatory requirements against things like employee and adversary behavior. You can be a superstar, build a world-class cybersecurity program, and follow best practices, providing exceptional protection for the organization. Despite this excellence, a single employee can click on a malicious web link, share a password, or misconfigure an asset, leading directly to a successful cyberattack. When this happens, it's your fault.
Yup, CISOs have heavy responsibilities. How are they dealing with this burden? Not very well, according to research from ESG and the information systems security association (ISSA). The data reveal that 57% of cybersecurity professionals believe their organization’s CISO is only somewhat effective, not very effective, or not at all effective.

Businesses’ use of email is increasing, with 82% of companies reporting a higher volume of email in 2022 compared with 2021 and 2020, the 2023 SOES report found. More email has led to more email-based threats, and 74% of respondents said these have risen over the past 12 months. While the increasing number of threats is a problem, it’s the growing sophistication of email attacks that poses the greatest danger, according to the report. “Cybercriminals continue to refine and adapt their strategies, and malware kits on the dark web make it possible even for common criminals without technology smarts to employ highly sophisticated methods of incursion,” it read. The increasingly sophisticated nature of attacks is the biggest challenge for 59% of respondents, with 76% predicting that an email-borne attack will have serious consequences for their organization in the coming year. Of these, 7% believe that such an attack is “inevitable,” while another three out of 10 consider it “extremely likely.”

The company only discovered the security breach following customer reports in early December 2022 that their sites were being used to redirect to random domains.
“Based on our investigation, we believe these incidents are part of a multi-year campaign by a sophisticated threat actor group that, among other things, installed malware on our systems and obtained pieces of code related to some services within GoDaddy,” the filing added.

Several of the most prevalent tactics, as defined by the MITRE ATT&CK framework, that were identified in the dataset aid lateral movement, including three new ones that rose into the top 10.
"An increase in the prevalence of techniques being performed to conduct lateral movement highlights the importance of enhancing threat prevention and detection both at the security perimeter as well as inside networks," researchers from cybersecurity firm Picus, said in their report.

The first group, Midnight Hedgehog, engages in payment fraud, while the second group, Mandarin Capybara, executes payroll diversion attacks. Both groups have launched BEC campaigns in at least 13 different languages, including Danish, Dutch, Estonian, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish, the researchers noted.
While attacking targets across various regions and using multiple languages is not new, in the past, these attacks were perpetrated mainly by sophisticated organizations with bigger budgets and more advanced resources, Crane Hassold, director of Threat Intelligence at Abnormal Security, wrote in his research.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the rapid growth and increasing complexity of cloud environments, organizations are increasingly at risk from various security threats. Cloud security posture management (CSPM) is a process that helps organizations continuously monitor, identify, and remediate security risks in the cloud. The use of automation in CSPM is crucial to ensuring the security and compliance of an organization's cloud infrastructure.
A key component of CSPM is the automation of its core tasks: continuous monitoring, remediation of issues, compliance management, and alerts and notifications. The integration of robotic process automation (RPA) in CSPM helps to reduce the need to perform repetitive and mundane tasks, making it a powerful tool for organizations to secure and streamline their cloud environment, support the overall security posture, and manage security risks more efficiently.

The law firm Baker McKenzie has launched a class action lawsuit against Medibank over the health insurer’s massive cyber attack last year that resulted in the personal details of up to 10 million customers being posted on the dark web.
In what became the largest breach of its kind to date in Australia, the hack on Medibank resulted in the personal details of 9.7 million current and former customers, including 5.1 million Medibank customers, 2.8 million ahm customers and 1.8 million international customers, being leaked.

Among other trends it identified, the report found that zero trust security policies have become more common, and uptake of a wide range of security tools has been sharply on the rise.
Okta survyed 17,000 customers globally, and found that zero trust usage among its  clients has increased from 10% two years ago to 22% today, indicating both that the philosophy is more popular than ever and that a wide swathe of the market is still there to be captured, according to the report.

The initiative is “a notable expansion of the group’s data exfiltration operations that traditionally targeted gov’t agencies and think tanks in Asia and Europe,” the team tweeted on Monday. 
DEV-0147’s attacks in South America included post-exploitation activity involving the abuse of on-premises identity infrastructure for reconnaissance and lateral movement, and the use of Cobalt Strike — a penetration testing tool — for command and control and data exfiltration, Microsoft wrote in its tweet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Israel-based startup Oligo Security is exiting stealth mode with the public launch of its namesake software, offering a new wrinkle in library-based application security monitoring, observability, and remediation. Utilizing a technology called extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF), it is able to provide agentless security coverage for open source code.
Given the prevalence of open source code in modern software — Oligo contends that it accounts for something like 80% or 90% — there is a need for software composition analysis solutions that can check the code for potential vulnerabilities. The current generation of solutions, however, is “noisy,” according to Oligo. It tends to produce a lot of false positives, and doesn’t contextualize alerts within a given runtime. The latter tendency is unhelpful for setting remediation priorities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As business processes become more complex, companies are turning to third parties to boost their ability to provide critical services from cloud storage to data management to security. It’s often more efficient and less expensive to contract out work that would otherwise require significant effort and potentially drain in-house resources to those who can do it for you.
The use of third-party services can also come with significant—often unforeseen—risks. Third parties can be a gateway for intrusions, harm a company’s reputation if a service malfunctions, expose it to financial and regulatory issues, and draw the attention of bad actors from around the world. A poorly managed breakup with a vendor can also be perilous, resulting in the loss of access to systems put in place by the third party, loss of custody of data, or loss of data itself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Descope has launched its first product, a platform designed to help developers add authentication and user management capabilities to their business-to-consumer and business-to-business applications. The software as a service is available now. Developers can access the product free of charge for up to 7,500 monthly active uses for B2C applications and up to 50 tenants for B2B apps. Beyond these there is a US$0.10 per user and US$20 per tenant.
The Descope platform aims to make it easier to build passwordless authentication, according to the company. Descope says the new product allows organizations to:

Create authentication flows and user-facing screens using a visual workflow designer.
Seamlessly add a variety of passwordless authentication methods to apps such as magic links, biometrics and passkeys (based on WebAuthn), authenticator apps, and social logins.
Validate, merge, and manage identities across the user journey.
Get business apps enterprise-ready with single sign-on (SSO), access control, tenant management, and automated user provisioning.
Enhance user protection by easily enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA), step-up, or biometric authentication within applications.
Descope’s platform offers different integration options: a no-code workflow builder and screen editor, a set of client and backend SDKs, and comprehensive REST APIs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unified endpoint management (UEM) is a strategic IT approach that consolidates how enterprises secure and manage an array of deployed devices including phones, tablets, PCs, and even IoT devices.
As remote and hybrid work models have become the norm over the past two years, “mobility management” has come to mean management of not just mobile devices, but all devices used by mobile employees wherever they are. UEM tools incorporate existing enterprise mobility management (EMM) technologies, such as mobile device management (MDM) and mobile application management (MAM), with tools used to manage desktop PCs and laptops.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If there was ever any doubt about the future of unified endpoint management (UEM) as a key component of enterprise mobility strategies, the now-permanent shift to hybrid and remote work models has sealed the deal. UEM has become a critical part of enterprise efforts to manage this complex environment.
Forrester Research’s 2022 Business Technographics Infrastructure Hardware Survey shows that 28% of infrastructure hardware technology decision makers will be investing in UEM over the next 12 months. “This is in line with previous years, so we continue to see stable growth in the UEM market,” says Andrew Hewitt, senior analyst at Forrester.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not too long ago, guarding access to the network was the focal point of defense for security teams. Powerful firewalls ensured that attackers were blocked on the outside while on the inside things might get “squishy,” allowing users fairly free rein within. Those firewalls were the ultimate defense—no one undesirable got access.
Until they did. With the advent of cloud computing, the edge of a network is no longer protected by a firewall. In fact, the network no longer has an edge: in our work-from-anywhere environment in which any data center is now a boundary, we can no longer rely on traditional protection mechanisms. Security has become more about protecting identity rather than the network itself.

At the same time, incident response engagements by industrial cybersecurity firm Dragos showed that 80% of impacted environments lacked visibility into ICS traffic and half had network segmentation issues and uncontrolled external connections into their OT networks.
"A number of the threats that Dragos tracks may evolve their disruptive and destructive capabilities in the future because adversaries often do extensive research and development (R&D) and build their programs and campaigns over time," the Dragos researchers said in a newly released annual report. "This R&D informs their future campaigns and ultimately increases their disruptive capabilities."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trustwave SpiderLabs researchers have cited an increased prevalence of HTML smuggling activity whereby cybercriminal groups abuse the versatility of HTML in combination with social engineering to distribute malware. The firm has detailed four recent HTML smuggling campaigns attempting to lure users into saving and opening malicious payloads, impersonating well-known brands such as Adobe Acrobat, Google Drive, and the US Postal Service to increase the chances of users falling victim.
HTML smuggling uses HTML5 attributes that can work offline by storing a binary in an immutable blob of data (or embedded payload) within JavaScript code, which is decoded into a file object when opened via a web browser. It is not a new attack method, but it has grown in popularity since Microsoft started blocking macros in documents from the internet by default, Trustwave SpiderLabs wrote. The four malware strains that have recently been detected using HTML smuggling in their infection chain are Cobalt Strike, Qakbot, IcedID, and Xworm RAT, the firm added.

While some may write this off as geopolitical shenanigans by China and nothing to fret about, I submit that it is emblematic of a nation-state using all resources available to acquire pieces of information and fill in the blanks on the mosaic they are building about a potential adversarial nation.
The physical threat posed by this balloon and the collection platform that dangled below it was negligible unless the balloon fell from the sky and landed in a populated area. It did not. When it met its demise, it was shot down by a US F-22 Raptor and fell into US territorial waters off the coast of South Carolina.

They build services, automate processes, and streamline deployments to support the core security team and its stakeholders. Security engineering teams are typically made up of software and infrastructure engineers, architects, and product managers.
The collective security/security engineering team mindset is also that of a builder, quite different from that of a penetration tester or third-party risk management assessor. This presents a challenge to security leaders. As security engineering teams continue to grow in prominence, CISOs need to be intentional with their structure and development.

As a result, security organizations are shifting their focus to proactive measures to stay ahead of emerging threats.

An ESG survey of 380 security professionals in North America, commissioned by cybersecurity company Syxsense, showed that companies using larger numbers of different tools to manage their endpoints had larger proportions of unmanaged endpoints, compared to those with fewer. Put simply, the complexity of the current-day device environment is leading to worse security, according to the research.

Cohesity 7.0 focuses on a “data-centric” approach to cyber resilience
In a press release, Cohesity explained that the 7.0 software release helps businesses take a more data-centric approach to cyber resilience including data immutability, data isolation (or cyber vaulting), and recovery at scale. “Organizations are facing significant challenges with managing and securing their data estate across cloud and on-premises, with ransomware and data theft as their number one concern,” commented Chris Kent, VP product and solutions marketing, Cohesity. “Cohesity Data Cloud 7.0 adds a new layer of protection and recovery to organizations’ most critical data.”

The caller also said he would harm first responders, too.
Groveland police chief Jeffrey Gillen summoned the police, fire, and emergency mutual aid of the nearby towns of Ipswich, Rowley, Topsfield, and Haverhill. Police evacuated neighboring homes around the house on Marjorie Street but soon found out that the call was a hoax, a "swatting" incident designed to draw significant police presence to a targeted location. So far, no arrests have been made.

<p>The penetration of government and corporate networks worldwide is the result of inadequate cyberdefenses across the board. The lessons are many, but I want to focus on one important one we’ve learned: the software that’s managing our critical networks isn’t secure, and that’s because the market doesn’t reward that security.</p>
<p>SolarWinds is a perfect example. The company was the initial infection vector for much of the operation. Its trusted position inside so many critical networks made it a perfect target for a supply-chain attack, and its shoddy security practices made it an easy target...</p>]]></summary>

Section 702 specifically addresses how the US government can conduct targeted surveillance of foreign persons located outside the US, with the compelled assistance of electronic communication service providers, to acquire foreign intelligence information.

OPSWAT’s MetaDefender line of kiosks is designed to address a potential security weakness for critical infrastructure defended by air gaps. In order to patch those systems, audit them, or move data among them, removable media like SD cards, USB sticks and sometimes even DVDs are used by field service personnel.
The vulnerability of the removable media is, therefore, a potential problem, according to OPSWAT vice president of products Pete Lund, not least in the sense that that media could be used to move sensitive information off of critical infrastructure.

Microsoft dubbed the threat group, which calls itself Holy Souls, NEPTUNIUM. It has also been identified as Emennet Pasargad by the US Department of Justice.
In January, the group claimed to have obtained the personal information of more than 200,000 Charlie Hebdo customers after access to a database, which Microsoft believes was in response to a cartoon contest conducted by the magazine. The information included a spreadsheet detailing the full names, telephone numbers, and home and email addresses of accounts that had subscribed to, or purchased merchandise from, the publication.

On her left forearm is a Latin phrase – facta non verba, actions not words – with a pair of devil’s horns; on her right, a feather, from the wings of an angel. Which is she, I wonder.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A critical vulnerability was fixed this week in Jira Service Management Server, a popular IT services management platform for enterprises, that could allow attackers to impersonate users and gain access to access tokens. If the system is configured to allow public sign-up, external customers can be affected as well.
The bug was introduced in Jira Service Management Server and Data Center 5.3.0, so versions 5.3.0 to 5.3.1 and 5.4.0 to 5.5.0 are affected. Atlassian has released fixed versions of the software but has also provided a workaround that involves updating a single JAR file in impacted deployments. Atlassian Cloud instances are not vulnerable.

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> In this paper we describe how to plant novel types of backdoors in any facial recognition model based on the popular architecture of deep Siamese neural networks, by mathematically changing a small fraction of its weights (i.e., without using any additional training or optimization). These backdoors force the system to err only on specific persons which are preselected by the attacker. For example, we show how such a backdoored system can take any two images of a particular person and decide that they represent different persons (an anonymity attack), or take any two images of a particular pair of persons and decide that they represent the same person (a confusion attack), with almost no effect on the correctness of its decisions for other persons. Uniquely, we show that multiple backdoors can be independently installed by multiple attackers who may not be aware of each other&#8217;s existence with almost no interference...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[VMware published patches last week for four vulnerabilities in its vRealize Log Insight product that, if combined, could allow attackers to take over the log collection and analytics platform. This week, a proof-of-concept exploit chain has been released by security researchers, along with detailed explanations for each vulnerability, meaning in-the-wild attacks could soon follow.
“Gaining access to the Log Insight host provides some interesting possibilities to an attacker, depending on the type of applications that are integrated with it,” researchers with penetration testing firm Horizon3.ai said in their analysis of the flaws. “Often logs ingested may contain sensitive data from other services and may allow an attack to gather session tokens, API keys, and PII. Those keys and sessions may allow the attacker to pivot to other systems and further compromise the environment.”

That’s according to a new study from BlackBerry, which surveyed 500 UK IT decision makers revealing that, while 60% of respondents see ChatGPT as generally being used for “good” purposes, 72% are concerned by its potential to be used for malicious purposes when it comes to cybersecurity. In fact, almost half (48%) predicted that a successful cyberattack will be credited to the technology within the next 12 months. The findings follow recent research which showed how attackers can use ChatGPT to significantly enhance phishing and business email compromise (BEC) scams.

The first geofence civil rights case to reach a federal court of appeals raises serious Fourth Amendment concerns against unreasonable search and seizure related to the location and personal information of mobile device users.
Geofence warrants have primarily been issued for Google to hand over data about every cell phone or other mobile device within a specific geographical region and timeframe. The problem: location data on every person carrying a mobile device in that area is scooped up in a wide net and their data is then handed over en masse to law enforcement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[State-sponsored threat groups increasingly use ransomware-like attacks as cover to hide more insidious activities. Russian advanced persistent threat (APT) group Sandworm used ransomware programs to destroy data multiple times over the past six months while North Korea's Lazarus group used infrastructure previously associated with a ransomware group for intelligence gathering campaigns.
At the same time, some Chinese APTs that were traditionally targeting entities in Asia shifted their focus to European companies, while Iran-based groups that traditionally targeted Israeli companies started going after their foreign subsidiaries. At least one North Korean group that was focused on South Korea and Russia has started using English in its operations. All these operational changes suggest organizations and companies from Western countries are at increased risk from APT activity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most people who operate DDoS-for-hire services attempt to hide their true identities and location. Proprietors of these so-called “booter” or “stresser” services — designed to knock websites and users offline — have long operated in a legally murky area of cybercrime law. But until recently, their biggest concern wasn’t avoiding capture or shutdown by the feds: It was minimizing harassment from unhappy customers or victims, and insulating themselves against incessant attacks from competing DDoS-for-hire services.

And then there are booter store operators like John Dobbs, a 32-year-old computer science graduate student living in Honolulu, Hawaii. For at least a decade until late last year, Dobbs openly operated IPStresser[.]com, a popular and powerful attack-for-hire service that he registered with the state of Hawaii using his real name and address. Likewise, the domain was registered in Dobbs’s name and hometown in Pennsylvania.

The only work experience Dobbs listed on his resume was as a freelance developer from 2013 to the present day. Dobbs’s resume doesn’t name his booter service, but in it he brags about maintaining websites with half a million page views daily, and “designing server deployments for performance, high-availability and security.”

In December 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice seized Dobbs’s IPStresser website and charged him with one count of aiding and abetting computer intrusions. Prosecutors say his service attracted more than two million registered users, and was responsible for launching a staggering 30 million distinct DDoS attacks.]]></summary>
