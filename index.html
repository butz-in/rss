The sanctions were announced today by the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) alongside the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). This follows a lengthy investigation by the National Crime Agency (NCA) into the crime group behind Trickbot malware, as well as the Conti and RYUK ransomware strains, among others, a NCA posting read.

                              <span>Trustwave SpiderLabs researchers have cited an increased prevalence of HTML smuggling activity whereby cybercriminal groups abuse the versatility of HTML in combination with social engineering to distribute malware. The firm has detailed four recent HTML smuggling campaigns attempting to lure users into saving and opening malicious payloads, impersonating well-known brands such as Adobe Acrobat, Google Drive, and the US Postal Service to increase the chances of users falling victim.
HTML smuggling uses HTML5 attributes that can work offline by storing a binary in an immutable blob of data (or embedded payload) within JavaScript code, which is decoded into a file object when opened via a web browser. It is not a new attack method, but it has grown in popularity since Microsoft started blocking macros in documents from the internet by default, Trustwave SpiderLabs wrote. The four malware strains that have recently been detected using HTML smuggling in their infection chain are Cobalt Strike, Qakbot, IcedID, and Xworm RAT, the firm added.

                              <span>The recent kerfuffle surrounding the Chinese surveillance balloon that sailed above Canada and the United States before meeting its demise off the southeastern coast of the United States has tongues wagging and heads scratching in equal measure. While some may write this off as geopolitical shenanigans by China and nothing to fret about, I submit that it is emblematic of a nation-state using all resources available to acquire pieces of information and fill in the blanks on the mosaic they are building about a potential adversarial nation.
The physical threat posed by this balloon and the collection platform that dangled below it was negligible unless the balloon fell from the sky and landed in a populated area. It did not. When it met its demise, it was shot down by a US F-22 Raptor and fell into US territorial waters off the coast of South Carolina.

                              <span>Security teams are comprised primarily of operations, compliance, and policy-related roles. Security engineering teams, on the other hand, are builders. They build services, automate processes, and streamline deployments to support the core security team and its stakeholders. Security engineering teams are typically made up of software and infrastructure engineers, architects, and product managers.
The collective security/security engineering team mindset is also that of a builder, quite different from that of a penetration tester or third-party risk management assessor. This presents a challenge to security leaders. As security engineering teams continue to grow in prominence, CISOs need to be intentional with their structure and development.

                              <span>Researchers warn that a new threat actor has been targeting over a thousand organizations since October with the goal of deploying credential-stealing malware. The attack chain also involves reconnaissance components including a Trojan that takes screenshots of the desktops of infected computers.
Tracked as TA866 by researchers from security firm Proofpoint, the group&#x27;s tooling seems to have similarities to other campaigns reported in the past under different names going as far back as 2019. Even though this latest activity appears to be financially motivated, some of the possibly related attacks seen in the past suggest that espionage was also a motivation at the time.

                              <span>Enterprises that use endpoint security and management technologies face a problem of growing marketplace “sprawl,” as new tools proliferate and options multiply, according to a study released today by the Enterprise Services Group.
Between the ongoing influence of remote work and IoT, the number and diversity of devices that have to be managed by endpoint security tools is on the rise. As a consequence, the number of available tools to manage them has also risen.
An ESG survey of 380 security professionals in North America, commissioned by cybersecurity company Syxsense, showed that companies using larger numbers of different tools to manage their endpoints had larger proportions of unmanaged endpoints, compared to those with fewer. Put simply, the complexity of the current-day device environment is leading to worse security, according to the research.

The release provides customers with enhanced cyber resiliency capabilities to help protect and secure data against cyberattacks, the firm stated in its announcement. Expanded features include privileged access hardening, accelerated ransomware recovery for files and objects, and attack surface reduction via AWS GovCloud support, Cohesity added.
Cohesity 7.0 focuses on a “data-centric” approach to cyber resilience
In a press release, Cohesity explained that the 7.0 software release helps businesses take a more data-centric approach to cyber resilience including data immutability, data isolation (or cyber vaulting), and recovery at scale. “Organizations are facing significant challenges with managing and securing their data estate across cloud and on-premises, with ransomware and data theft as their number one concern,” commented Chris Kent, VP product and solutions marketing, Cohesity. “Cohesity Data Cloud 7.0 adds a new layer of protection and recovery to organizations’ most critical data.”

                              <span>At around 8:45 pm on February 1, 2023, a caller to the Groveland, Massachusetts, 911 emergency line told dispatchers that he harmed someone in a home on Marjorie Street in the upscale small town 34 miles north of Boston. The caller also said he would harm first responders, too.
Groveland police chief Jeffrey Gillen summoned the police, fire, and emergency mutual aid of the nearby towns of Ipswich, Rowley, Topsfield, and Haverhill. Police evacuated neighboring homes around the house on Marjorie Street but soon found out that the call was a hoax, a &quot;swatting&quot; incident designed to draw significant police presence to a targeted location. So far, no arrests have been made.

The surge is coming from numerous malware families, including AuroraStealer, IcedID, Meta Stealer, RedLine Stealer, Vidar, Formbook, and XLoader. In the past, these families typically relied on phishing and malicious spam that attached Microsoft Word documents with booby-trapped macros. Over the past month, Google Ads has become the go-to place for criminals to spread their malicious wares that are disguised as legitimate downloads by impersonating brands such as Adobe Reader, Gimp, Microsoft Teams, OBS, Slack, Tor, and Thunderbird...</span>

APIs may not seem like the sexiest thing to write about in a tech newsletter, but bear with me. Because APIs – or application programming interfaces – are important. They’re the synapses of our digital world: without them, our current ways of living wouldn’t work.

OPSWAT’s MetaDefender line of kiosks is designed to address a potential security weakness for critical infrastructure defended by air gaps. In order to patch those systems, audit them, or move data among them, removable media like SD cards, USB sticks and sometimes even DVDs are used by field service personnel.
The vulnerability of the removable media is, therefore, a potential problem, according to OPSWAT vice president of products Pete Lund, not least in the sense that that media could be used to move sensitive information off of critical infrastructure.

                              <span>Microsoft’s Digital Threat Analysis Center (DTAC) has attributed a recent influence operation targeting the satirical French magazine Charlie Hebdo to an Iranian nation-state actor. Microsoft dubbed the threat group, which calls itself Holy Souls, NEPTUNIUM. It has also been identified as Emennet Pasargad by the US Department of Justice.
In January, the group claimed to have obtained the personal information of more than 200,000 Charlie Hebdo customers after access to a database, which Microsoft believes was in response to a cartoon contest conducted by the magazine. The information included a spreadsheet detailing the full names, telephone numbers, and home and email addresses of accounts that had subscribed to, or purchased merchandise from, the publication.

                              <span>If there’s an intrusion or a ransomware attack on your company, will your security team come out swinging, ready for a real fight? CISOs may feel their staff is always primed with the technical expertise and training they need, but there’s still a chance they might freeze up when the pressure is on, says Bec McKeown, director of human science at cybersecurity training platform Immersive Labs.
“You may have a crisis playbook and crisis policies and you may assume those are the first things you’ll reach for during an incident. But that’s not always the case, because the way your brain works isn’t just fight or flight. It’s fight, flight, or freeze,” she says. “I’ve heard people say, ‘We knew how to respond to a crisis, but we didn’t know what to do when it actually happened.’”

                              <span>The field of machine learning (ML) security—and corresponding adversarial ML—is rapidly advancing as researchers develop sophisticated techniques to perturb, disrupt, or steal the ML model or data. It’s a heady time; because we know so little about the security of these systems, there are many opportunities for new researchers to publish in this field. In many ways, this circumstance reminds me of the cryptanalysis field in the 1990. And there is a lesson in that similarity: the complex mathematical attacks make for good academic papers, but we mustn’t lose sight of the fact that insecure software will be the likely attack vector for most ML systems...</span>

In a world where you can scan the veins in your hand to unlock a smartphone, how do you maintain control over personal data? Biometric authentication, the use of distinctive human features like iris patterns, fingerprints and even gait in lieu of a password, is gaining ground in the tech world.
Proponents tout its inherent, hard-to-replicate qualities as a security benefit, while detractors see the same features as an invasion of privacy. Both sides may be right.

Unlike a password, you can’t forget your face at home. But also, unlike a password, you can’t reset your face — meani…</span>

I have done a written interview and a  podcast interview about the book. It’s been chosen as a “February 2023 Must-Read Book” by the Next Big Idea Club. And an “Editor’s Pick”—whatever that means—on Amazon.
There have been three reviews so far. I am hoping for more. And maybe even a published excerpt or two.
Amazon and others will start shipping the book on Tuesday. If you ordered a signed copy from me, it is already in the mail.
If you can leave a review somewhere, I would appreciate it.

                              <span>Interesting research: “Facial Misrecognition Systems: Simple Weight Manipulations Force DNNs to Err Only on Specific Persons“:
Abstract: In this paper we describe how to plant novel types of backdoors in any facial recognition model based on the popular architecture of deep Siamese neural networks, by mathematically changing a small fraction of its weights (i.e., without using any additional training or optimization). These backdoors force the system to err only on specific persons which are preselected by the attacker. For example, we show how such a backdoored system can take any two images of a particular person and decide that they represent different persons (an anonymity attack), or take any two images of a particular pair of persons and decide that they represent the same person (a confusion attack), with almost no effect on the correctness of its decisions for other persons. Uniquely, we show that multiple backdoors can be independently installed by multiple attackers who may not be aware of each other’s existence with almost no interference...</span>

                              <span>A critical vulnerability was fixed this week in Jira Service Management Server, a popular IT services management platform for enterprises, that could allow attackers to impersonate users and gain access to access tokens. If the system is configured to allow public sign-up, external customers can be affected as well.
The bug was introduced in Jira Service Management Server and Data Center 5.3.0, so versions 5.3.0 to 5.3.1 and 5.4.0 to 5.5.0 are affected. Atlassian has released fixed versions of the software but has also provided a workaround that involves updating a single JAR file in impacted deployments. Atlassian Cloud instances are not vulnerable.

                              <span>VMware published patches last week for four vulnerabilities in its vRealize Log Insight product that, if combined, could allow attackers to take over the log collection and analytics platform. This week, a proof-of-concept exploit chain has been released by security researchers, along with detailed explanations for each vulnerability, meaning in-the-wild attacks could soon follow.
“Gaining access to the Log Insight host provides some interesting possibilities to an attacker, depending on the type of applications that are integrated with it,” researchers with penetration testing firm Horizon3.ai said in their analysis of the flaws. “Often logs ingested may contain sensitive data from other services and may allow an attack to gather session tokens, API keys, and PII. Those keys and sessions may allow the attacker to pivot to other systems and further compromise the environment.”

                              <span>Most UK IT leaders believe that foreign states are already using the ChatGPT chatbot for malicious purposes against other nations. That’s according to a new study from BlackBerry, which surveyed 500 UK IT decision makers revealing that, while 60% of respondents see ChatGPT as generally being used for “good” purposes, 72% are concerned by its potential to be used for malicious purposes when it comes to cybersecurity. In fact, almost half (48%) predicted that a successful cyberattack will be credited to the technology within the next 12 months. The findings follow recent research which showed how attackers can use ChatGPT to significantly enhance phishing and business email compromise (BEC) scams.

                              <span>State-sponsored threat groups increasingly use ransomware-like attacks as cover to hide more insidious activities. Russian advanced persistent threat (APT) group Sandworm used ransomware programs to destroy data multiple times over the past six months while North Korea&#x27;s Lazarus group used infrastructure previously associated with a ransomware group for intelligence gathering campaigns.
At the same time, some Chinese APTs that were traditionally targeting entities in Asia shifted their focus to European companies, while Iran-based groups that traditionally targeted Israeli companies started going after their foreign subsidiaries. At least one North Korean group that was focused on South Korea and Russia has started using English in its operations. All these operational changes suggest organizations and companies from Western countries are at increased risk from APT activity.

                              <span>A new open framework has been launched to outline a comprehensive and actionable way for businesses and security teams to understand attacker behaviors and techniques specifically impacting the software supply chain. The Open Software Supply Chain Attack Reference (OSC&amp;R) initiative, led by OX Security, evaluates software supply chain security threats, covering a wide range of attack vectors including vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and components, supply chain attacks on build and deployment systems, and compromised or malicious software updates. Cybersecurity professionals among the matrix’s founding consortium include representatives from GitLab as well as former leaders from Microsoft, Google Cloud, Check Point Technologies, and OWASP.

While zero trust is a top priority, data showed that least privilege access rights, an underpinning of zero trust architecture, are not properly enforced. Almost 90% of granted permissions are not used, which leaves many opportunities for attackers who steal credentials, the report noted.

Polite, Jr., shared the 2022 success of the Criminal Division of the DOJ in its pursuit of corrupt and criminal activities within corporations that “threaten the public safety and national security, [and] wrongfully divert money into the pockets of criminal actors” at a mid-January event at Georgetown University’s Law Center.

While January included a huge release of patches, several releases in other months have provided more than one headache for the patch management community. These are the patches and updates you need to evaluate if you haven’t already done so.
BitLocker Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability
In January, additional information came out about CVE-2022-41099, the BitLocker Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability. If you’ve already deployed the November or later security updates to your network and have done nothing else, you aren’t done with the evaluation of this update.

Since launching in 2016, Google&#x27;s free OSS-Fuzz code testing service has helped get over 8800 vulnerabilities and 28,000 bugs fixed across 850 projects. Today, we’re happy to announce an expansion of our OSS-Fuzz Rewards Program, plus new features in OSS-Fuzz and our involvement in supporting academic fuzzing research. 
Refreshed OSS-Fuzz rewards 
  
The OSS-Fuzz project&#x27;s purpose is to support the open source community in adopting fuzz testing, or fuzzing — an automated code testing technique for uncovering bugs in software. In addition to the OSS-Fuzz service, which provides a free platform for continuous fuzzing to critical open source projects, we established an OSS-Fuzz Reward Program in 2017 as part of our wider Patch Rewards Program.

What’s the problem?
NTIA is the principal advisor on telecommunications and Internet policy to the Biden administration. It argues that the way things are run at present may be “harmful,” arguing that Google&#x27;s and Apple’s “gatekeeper” positions may harm consumers by raising prices and reducing innovation.

Their products and services range from person and business verification, to no-code workflow building, low-code integrations, and anti-fraud measures. The new platform combines all these solutions into a single contract for clients who can use the platform to access information matching, identity document verification, proof of address through utility data, in-depth business verification, and watchlist screening with ongoing monitoring.

                              <span>As technology continues to become increasingly integrated into our daily lives, the threat of cyber attacks and ransomware attacks has become more prevalent than ever. A cyber incident response plan (CIRP) is a critical tool for any organisation to protect against and respond to potential cyber threats. 
 
This guide will take you through what the important elements of a good cyber incident response plan are. We also cover the six phases of a Cyber Incident Response Plan, based on NIST incident response guidance. We will also show you how to effectively implement this plan and maintain your incident response capability.</span>

                              <span>In a recent study, 84% of respondents indicated their concern over how their data is collected, and about privacy measures taken for their data security. They also voiced the desire for more control over how their personally identifiable information (PII) is being used. 
 
In today&#x27;s tech-centred world, there are hacks, data breaches, and illegal releases of personal information almost every day. Centralised infrastructure can be challenged in the domain of information security, and the need to stay on top of your organisation’s cyber security is at an all-time high. PII scanning can help you with that.</span>

                              <span>Apple this year is marking Data Privacy Week by working to educate iPhone users about the privacy protection tools they already have in hand, a move that has implications across any business that wants to maintain privacy.
Data protection is the bedrock of business
Data Privacy Week grew out of the Jan. 28, 2007 first convention on data protection. Today, it’s a global event that aims to raise awareness around privacy and data protection.

                              <span>One of the big surprises in Russia’s war against Ukraine has been how well Ukraine has fended off Russian cyberattacks. Ad hoc groups of white-hat hackers have helped, as have a number of nations and the US government.
Less well known is that tech companies, including Microsoft, are part of the effort. That aid ranges from giving advice to identifying attacks, offering fixes for them, and providing Ukraine with free tech and security services.
Microsoft isn’t just trying to help defend a country under siege from an aggressive, more-powerful neighbor. Russian cyberattacks against Ukraine can also get loose in the wild and do damage to enterprises and organizations that rely on Microsoft technology. (Russia could also deliberately target private companies with those attacks.)

                              <span>There is a possibility that artificial intelligence (AI) will have a significant influence, in either a good or bad direction, on cybersecurity. On the plus side, artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to automate and improve many parts of cybersecurity.

On the other hand, artificial intelligence also creates new security holes and problems that must be fixed.
Processing massive volumes of data and seeing patterns that people would overlook are two of the primary advantages that artificial intelligence brings to the field of cybersecurity. This could be especially helpful for finding attacks like zero-day vulnerabilities and advanced persist…</span>

IdentityIQ
Shoulder surfing is a type of identity theft practice where someone tries to steal confidential information by spying over their target&#x27;s shoulder. The objective of shoulder surfing is to steal sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers or personal identification numbers (PINs) that can later be used to access accounts for financial gain.

                              <span>If you are reading this, you might be wondering what the value of IT security training could be for your organisation. Security awareness training teaches your colleagues how to practice good security habits and reduces the risk of a security breach. But at the end of the day, the kind of training you can give your colleagues often comes down to what your budget allows. In this blog post, we use data to explain why security training is well worth the upfront cost. For example, did you know that organisations have about a 30% chance of experiencing a security breach in the next two years? Or that using security training reduces the security cost of an employee by 52%? 
 
We’ll go over training costs, the consequences of security breaches, and the average ROI of training. Happy reading!</span>

                              <span>Most people who operate DDoS-for-hire services attempt to hide their true identities and location. Proprietors of these so-called “booter” or “stresser” services — designed to knock websites and users offline — have long operated in a legally murky area of cybercrime law. But until recently, their biggest concern wasn’t avoiding capture or shutdown by the feds: It was minimizing harassment from unhappy customers or victims, and insulating themselves against incessant attacks from competing DDoS-for-hire services.

And then there are booter store operators like John Dobbs, a 32-year-old computer science graduate student living in Honolulu, Hawaii. For at least a decade until late last year, Dobbs openly operated IPStresser[.]com, a popular and powerful attack-for-hire service that he registered with the state of Hawaii using his real name and address. Likewise, the domain was registered in Dobbs’s name and hometown in Pennsylvania.

The only work experience Dobbs listed on his resume was as a freelance developer from 2013 to the present day. Dobbs’s resume doesn’t name his booter service, but in it he brags about maintaining websites with half a million page views daily, and “designing server deployments for performance, high-availability and security.”

In December 2022, the U.S. Department of Justice seized Dobbs’s IPStresser website and charged him with one count of aiding and abetting computer intrusions. Prosecutors say his service attracted more than two million registered users, and was responsible for launching a staggering 30 million distinct DDoS attacks.</span>

                              <span>The first Patch Tuesday of the year from Microsoft addresses 98 security vulnerabilities, with 10 classified as critical for Windows. One vulnerability (CVE-2023-21674) in a core section of Windows code is a zero-day that requires immediate attention. And Adobe has returned with a critical update, paired with a few low-profile patches for the Microsoft Edge browser.
We have added the Windows and Adobe updates to our “Patch Now” list, recognizing that this month’s patch deployments will require significant testing and engineering effort. The team at Application Readiness has provided a helpful infographic that outlines the risks associated with each of the updates for this January update cycle.

After reading this, you should have a general idea of what Privacy by Design means, how it relates to the 7 principles of the GDPR, and how it can help even the smallest businesses elevate their privacy and data protection.</span>
